        I was raised in the suburbs of Chicago (Naperville, if you want to get technical) on a steady diet of pizza and Star Wars. In high school I programmed my graphing calculator to give me the area, surface area, volume, and perimeter for any given shape.
        My geometry class got a lot easier after that, and my love of solving problems with technology began.

        So, I learned to code. HTML, CSS, Javascript, AngularJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, d3.js...anything that would help me achieve my vision. Web development lets me fulfill my need for creativity but also allows me to solve problems at a very large
        scale. Currently I live in Provo, UT with my wife and son.

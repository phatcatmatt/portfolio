    <p class="project_text">
      Displays the number of 'favorites' and 'retweets' per tweet for any public Twitter user as well as a graph showing the user's follower count over time.<br><br>

      Each Twitter user searched on the site is stored in my database where the server requests an updated follower count from Twitter on a regular interval. This information is stored again in the database and presented
      as a D3 chart. This allows the user to correlate any follower increase or decrease to a given tweet or time period and analyze trends for any public account.<br><br>

      Won runner-up for "Most Technical App".<br><br>

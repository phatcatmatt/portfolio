      This tool was built to help Dev Mountain address the needs of its student housing administration.
      Since new students come in every 6 weeks, they needed a place where everything could be managed easily and quickly.
      It is currently deployed and being used by Dev Mountain.<br><br>

      It allows admins to assign and update current and future housing across all cohorts and all three campuses.
      Admins can also view and update user info (track and update deposit payments, housing agreements, work orders, etc).<br><br>

      Students can use it to apply for housing, view housing assignment, sign up for check-in and check-out appointments, place work orders, view FAQs, and more.<br><br>

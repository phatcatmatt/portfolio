      This tool was built to help Dev Mountain address the needs of student housing administration. It allows admins to assign and update current and future housing across all cohorts and all three campuses, as well as view and update user info (track and update deposit payments, housing agreements, work orders, etc). It also allows students to apply for housing, view housing assignment, place work orders, view FAQs, and more.<br><br>

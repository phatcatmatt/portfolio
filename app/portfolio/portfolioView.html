      <p class="project_text">
        Built with HTML5, CSS, Angular, MongoDB, Express, Node, and d3. Uses Twitter's API to allow users to search public profiles and display dynamic data with d3.js.<br><br>
        Twitter doesn't let you access a user's follower history, only their current follower count, so I do it for you. I save each searched profile in my database and check the accounts current followers on a regular basis and store that data so the follower count history can be presented using d3.js.
        This allows the user analyze follower trends for any public account. I also access each account's past tweets and chart them so you can see which recent tweets were the most popular with their followers in terms of retweets and favorites.<br><br>
        Won award as runner-up in "Most Technical" category.<br><br>

              I took an Amazon Dash Button and figured out a way to send a text to my wife saying what time I will be home.
              <br>
              <br> It uses a Raspberry Pi connected to the router to watch the network for ARP requests that match the MAC address of the Dash Button. When it sees the Dash Button's ARP request it runs the other scripts to get travel time and send a text message. It gets estimated travel times from Google Maps and the sends the text message with Twilio. It's pretty simple and more of a proof of concept than a practical solution but I had fun learning some networking, linux, and Python 3. You could easily drop in any other script and have it run on button press instead (turn on lights, take a picture, scrape a website, etc).

            This tool was built to help Dev Mountain address the needs of its student housing administration. It is currently deployed and being used
            by Dev Mountain.
            <br>
            <br> It allows admins to assign and update students' housing assignment for current and future cohorts across all three campuses. Admins can also view and update user info (track and update deposit payments, housing agreements, work orders, etc).
            <br>
            <br> Students can use it to apply for housing while at Dev Mountain, view housing assignment, sign up for check-in and check-out appointments, place work orders, view FAQs, and more.
